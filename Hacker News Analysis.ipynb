Ask HM posts receive the most comments from the community, with almost double the number of comments compared to Show HM posts, and tend to have a greater chance of becoming viral. Show HM posts, however, receieve more points compared to Ask HM, though the averages are similar. To receive the most number of comments and points on an Ask HM post, one should post at 3 PM EST, when the user-base is most active."
